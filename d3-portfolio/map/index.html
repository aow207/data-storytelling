        <h3>221b Baker St.</h3>
        <p>
            November 1895. London is shrouded in fog and Sherlock Holmes and
            Watson pass time restlessly awaiting a new case. "The London
            criminal is certainly a dull fellow," Sherlock bemoans. "There have
            been numerous petty thefts," Watson offers in response. Just then a
            telegram arrives from Sherlock's brother Mycroft with a mysterious
            case.

        <h3>Aldgate Station</h3>
        <p>
            Arthur Cadogan West was found dead, head crushed in on train tracks
            at Aldgate Station at 6AM Tuesday morning. West worked at Woolwich
            Arsenal on the Bruce-Partington submarine, a secret military
            project. Plans for the submarine had been stolen and seven of the
            ten missing papers were found in West's possession. Mycroft implores
            Sherlock to take the case and recover the three missing papers.

        <h3>London Bridge</h3>
        <p>
            Holmes and Watson's investigations take them across London. Sherlock
            deduces that West was murdered elsewhere, then moved to Aldgate
            Station to create the illusion that he was crushed on the tracks by
            a train. On their way to Woolwich Sherlock dispatches a telegram to
            Mycroft at London Bridge: "Send list of all foreign spies known to
            be in England, with full address."

        <h3>Woolwich Arsenal</h3>
        <p>
            While investigating at Woolwich Arsenal Sherlock learns that West
            did not have the three keys&mdash;door, office, and
            safe&mdash;necessary to steal the papers. The train station clerk
            mentions seeing an agitated West boarding the 8:15 train to London
            Bridge. Sherlock suspects West of following someone who had access
            to the Woolwich chief's keyring with all three keys.

        <p>
            Mycroft responds to Sherlock's telegram and mentions several spies.
            Hugo Oberstein of 13 Caulfield Gardens catches Sherlock's eye. He
            heads to the nearby Gloucester Road station to investigate and
            learns that the windows of Caulfield Gardens open over rail tracks
            where trains stop frequently.
