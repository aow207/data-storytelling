            <h3>New York, Meet Amazon</h3>
            <p>
                There are over 1.5 million packages delivered every day in New York City and 90,000 of them will be lost and potentially reordered again. It’s safe to say that New York’s carbon footprint isn’t looking too good.<br><br>
                With five Amazon Distribution Centers in the city, you’d think that deliveries could move more efficiently, but that’s often not the case.

            <p>
                Amazon ships packages to companies like LaserShip who then deliver the packages to you.</p>

                New York’s five Amazon Distribution Centers aren’t enough to fully serve the demand of shopaholic New Yorkers.</p>

            <p>
                The areas that shop the most online don’t line up with the number of major distribution centers in each state. In return, “last-mile” deliveries or one-package-per-stop trips are increasingly adding up to triple the carbon footprint of ordering online.</p>

            <p>
                These last-mile deliveries are at their worst during the holiday season.</p>
